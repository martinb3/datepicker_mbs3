<p>This Java-based Karaoke player reads the Audio+G zip format, which is a loosely standardized process of zipping an .mp3 and .cdg file inside a zip file that shares the same name as both of the individual files. The .cdg file format information was gleaned from <a href="http://www.jbum.com/cdg_revealed.html">CD+G Revealed</a> and I also checked out <a href="http://www.kibosh.org/pykaraoke/">PyKaraoke</a> to help me interpret the aforementioned document. The sources contain a Swing component that can be fed CDG packets by a dispatcher class. For the music part of the player, I borrowed the <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/jlgui/jlgui.html">jlGui player's</a> BasicPlayer component as well as the <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/mp3spi/mp3spi.html">MP3SPI driver</a> from the same source. The player doesn't do any display shifting or scrolling yet, so any really fancy CD+G instructions won't work if they do display shifting or scrolling. This is a really enjoyable project that I'd like to revisit when I have the time.</p>
